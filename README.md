# SingleCellModeling
Code for the publication "Generation and analysis of context-specific genome-scale 
metabolic models derived from single-cell RNA-Seq data"

Important: For this code to work, the files in the "ChangesToRAVEN" folder may need to 
replace the corresponding files in RAVEN, depending on the RAVEN version. We plan
to implement ftINIT in RAVEN, and as part of that, this issue will be handled, but
in the current state, the files need to be replaced.
